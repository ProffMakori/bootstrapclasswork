<p class="container text-light">I have a natural aptitude for mathematics and have always enjoyed working with numbers.' It was my most successful and satisfying school subject, and I very much want to continue to use my talents in undertaking a Computer Science degree course.' My ability in maths led me to enter a number of competitions, both in my homeland and in the UK, and I hold certificates of success from all of these events.' The great appeal of mathematics for me is its power to solve problems, and I am fully aware that IT is the logical extension of this power. I am in a journey to explore more of computing and diving into the vast technology industry.</p>
